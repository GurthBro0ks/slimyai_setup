Session Recap
============
- Migrated database (snapshots/loadouts/icon atlas columns) and widened phash to char(64).
- Implemented multi-screenshot /snail analyze flow with radar + icon detection, plus mysql2 fixes.
- Seeded initial icon atlas + smoke test assets from supersnail wiki.
- Rebuilt and redeployed bot container; redeployed slash commands.
- Resolved runtime iterable error; confirmed smoke tests passing locally.

Recommended Next Steps
======================
1. Gather more labeled screenshots to refine screen-detector heuristics.
2. Expand icons atlas with curated crops to boost confidence scores.
3. Add graceful handling or configuration for Redis inside the container.
