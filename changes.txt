**slimy.ai** is a Discord-native AI that adapts to your crew’s rhythm (remembers conversations, adapts over time, and slowly evolves with server participation). 

It has **four modes** that can be turned on/off independently per *channel* or *category*.

### Modes
- **1) admin** — locks admin panel/commands for server settings (gated by channel perms or admin-only visibility).  
  • Keep mode, channel, and general settings accessible for admins while other modes run.

- **2) personality** — playful sparks, big ideas, dopamine fuel. Optional photo generator; uses sheets or a temp cache for user-specific data and chat memory. Attitude grows with users.  
  _Examples_: “show me a snail wearing sunglasses, Picasso style, Discord-ready (not Mike from yesterday).” “Make me a meme (remember my inside jokes).”

- **3) no_personality** — straight answers and image generation; minimal voice.

- **4) super_snail** — listens for Super Snail chat data, organizes, plans, and uses Google Sheets.  
  • Listens to assigned channels in this mode.  
  • Personality can still adapt via member chat.  
  • Sources: Super Snail wiki, subreddit, and snelp.com; plus Google Sheets + image refs.  
  • Players can upload stat screenshots; slimy.ai asks for any missing details and proposes upgrade paths.  
  • Admins can upload Species War screenshots to a weekly sheet for club-wide stats (participation, etc.).

### Scope
- Conversational core with memory  
- Per-channel personas (modes) + admin controls  
- Image generation with safety filters  
- Super Snail specialist flow: screenshot → OCR → Sheets → wiki/snelp enrichment; @mention for chat

### Design values
- Phase-by-phase plan  
- Small loops > long lectures  
- Clear status, crisp tags, humane defaults  
- “Repo” feel: channels as files, forums as folders
