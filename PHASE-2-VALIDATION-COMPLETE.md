## 🧪 Testing Capabilities

### Automated Tests

**What Can Be Tested Automatically:**
- ✅ Chat message handling
- ✅ Mention detection and response
- ✅ Basic memory operations (via @mention)
- ✅ Performance metrics (response times)
- ✅ Edge case handling (empty, long, special chars)
- ✅ Error recovery
- ✅ Personality analysis (0-10 score)

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Cannot trigger slash commands (Discord API restriction)
- ⚠️ Personality verification needs human judgment
- ⚠️ Visual elements require manual check

### Manual Tests

**What Requires Human Testing:**
- All 8 mode profile personality differences
- Rating system content appropriateness
- Mode persistence across restarts
- Mode inheritance (category → channel → thread)
- All slash commands (/mode, /snail, /dream, /diag)
- Visual quality (images, embeds)
- Google Sheets integration

## 🎯 Mode Profile Testing Plan

### The 8 Profiles to Validate

1. **Chat · Personality · Rated PG-13**
   - Expected: Playful, creative, appropriate

2. **Chat · Personality · Unrated**
   - Expected: MORE playful, creative freedom

3. **Chat · No Personality · Rated PG-13**
   - Expected: Concise, neutral, appropriate
   - **CRITICAL:** Must be NOTICEABLY different from #1

4. **Chat · No Personality · Unrated**
   - Expected: Concise, neutral, technical freedom

5. **Super Snail · Personality · Rated PG-13**
   - Expected: Playful game advice, appropriate

6. **Super Snail · Personality · Unrated**
   - Expected: Creative game advice, freedom

7. **Super Snail · No Personality · Rated PG-13**
   - Expected: Concise game facts, appropriate
   - **CRITICAL:** Must differ from #5

8. **Super Snail · No Personality · Unrated**
   - Expected: Concise, technical game advice

### Critical Success Criteria

**MUST PASS:**
- Personality profiles score 5+ on personality scale
- No Personality profiles score 0-3 on personality scale
- Difference between Personality/No Personality is obvious to humans
- Rating system creates visible content differences

**If These Fail:**
- 🔴 CRITICAL FAILURE - Phase 2 not production ready
- Requires persona.json updates
- Must retest after fixes

## 🔍 Personality Analysis Algorithm

The automated tests include a personality analyzer that scores responses 0-10:

### Scoring System
```
Starting score: 0

ADD points for:
+ 2: Contains emoji (✨🎉🔥 etc)
+ 3: Uses catchphrases ("exploit secured", "rivers branch")
+ 2: Playful tone ("haha", "!!", "let's", "check this out")
+ 2: Creative metaphors ("like X but Y", "think of X as")

SUBTRACT points for:
- 5: Neutral/professional tone
- 2: Concise without playfulness

Final score: Clamped to 0-10 range
```

### Interpretation
- **0-2:** No personality, very neutral
- **3-4:** Minimal personality
- **5-6:** Moderate personality
- **7-8:** Strong personality
- **9-10:** Maximum personality

### Expected Scores by Profile
- **Personality modes:** Should score 5-10
- **No Personality modes:** Should score 0-3
- **Difference:** At least 3 points between Personality/No Personality

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Test bot can't connect"**
- Check TEST_DISCORD_TOKEN is valid
- Verify bot has permissions
- Check network connection

**"No response from slimy.ai"**
- Verify bot is online: `pm2 status slimy-bot`
- Check bot has channel access
- Review bot logs: `pm2 logs slimy-bot`

**"Personality differences not visible"**
- This is expected to require tuning
- Review persona.json
- Check mode is actually set: `/mode view`
- Try more extreme test prompts

**"Slash commands don't work"**
- Run: `node deploy-commands.js`
- Wait 1 hour for global propagation
- Or use guild-specific deployment for testing
