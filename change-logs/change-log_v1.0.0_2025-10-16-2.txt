Date: 2025-10-16 (Session wrap-up)

Highlights:
- Deployed `/snail analyze` multi-attachment flow to Discord (command redeploy run).
- Fixed mysql2 result handling in lib/snapshots.js and lib/loadouts.js to eliminate runtime iterable errors.
- Seeded starter icon atlas and ran smoke harness with wiki-provided screenshots.

Operational Steps:
- mysql -h 127.0.0.1 ... < scripts/create-v3-analyze.sql
- DB_* overrides node scripts/seed-icon-atlas.js
- DB_* overrides node scripts/analyze-smoke.js
- DB_* overrides node scripts/db-test.js
- docker compose build bot && docker compose up -d bot
- node deploy-commands.js (guild 1176605506912141444)

Current Status:
- Bot container rebuilt and healthy; commands registered with extra attachment fields.
- Snapshot/loadout tables and icon atlas populated with initial entries.

Follow-ups:
- Gather more labeled screenshots to refine screen detection and confidence heuristics.
- Expand icon atlas with higher-quality crops for more reliable matching.
- Evaluate Redis connectivity inside container (currently logging ECONNREFUSED when not running).
