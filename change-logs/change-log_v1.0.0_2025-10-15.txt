slimy.ai Bot v1.0.0 – Session Summary (2025-10-15)

Key Work Completed
- Added hourly Snelp scraper with redis-backed caching and live code storage in MySQL; `/snail codes` now shows public results with a copy button and posts alerts for new codes.
- Expanded `/snail analyze` to enrich stats, store recommendations in the new `snail_recommendations` table, and operate without Google Sheets by default (feature toggle and DB persistence).
- Hardened vision parsing with a refinement pass to reduce stat misreads and improved Redis resilience to avoid hangs when the cache is offline.
- Introduced maintenance tooling (db-test script, change-log folder) and migration updates to keep schema idempotent.

Tests & Validation
- `node scripts/db-test.js`
- Manual scraper dry run (`scrapeSnelpCodes`) and MySQL seed verification
- Container rebuild/restarts after each major change (`docker compose build bot && docker compose up -d bot`)

Follow-Ups
- Configure `CODES_ALERT_CHANNEL_ID`/`CODES_ALERT_ROLE_ID` in `.env` to receive new-code ping alerts.
- Re-enable Sheets later (set `FEATURE_SHEETS=true`) once Google Drive storage issues are resolved.
