Manual QA Checklist — Oct 22
================================

/club analyze
- Upload 3–6 real “Manage Members” screenshots (mix of Sim and Total Power views).
- Verify Preview highlights: missing vs last week, new names, suspicious jumps (±85% default), low-confidence rows flagged.
- Enable OCR boost and confirm newly extracted rows appear in the preview.
- Use the Manual Fix modal to correct a name and fill missing values; rerun to ensure alias persists.
- Approve & Commit and confirm the Google Sheet “Club Latest” tab refreshes and sorts by Total Power.
- Re-run within the same week and confirm the latest snapshot overwrites without duplicating history.

/club stats
- Run with `metric=both`, `top=10`, `format=embed`; verify tables render with arrows, % bars, totals, and averages.
- Run with `format=csv`; open the attachment and confirm all expected columns are present.
- Run as a non-admin user without the club role and confirm a polite permission denial is returned.

Permissions & Links
- Click the “Open Sheet” button and confirm admins or the club role can view the sheet.
- Attempt access as a non-member and confirm visibility is denied.

Edge Cases
- First-ever week: ensure percent (% ) columns remain blank and no divide-by-zero occurs.
- Extremely large totals render with thousands separators (no scientific notation).
- Names containing emojis or tags normalize to the same member record.
