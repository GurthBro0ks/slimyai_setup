SLIMY.AI BOT - UPDATE LOG
===========================================

Date: 2025-10-06
Session: Memory System Bugs Fixed + GPT-4 Vision Integration

-------------------------------------------
1. FIXED: Memory System Critical Bugs ✅
-------------------------------------------

STATUS: ALL 5 BUGS FIXED - PRODUCTION READY
Test Results: 10/10 PASS (100%)

BUG FIXES:
1. Bug #1 (CRITICAL): Race Conditions in Concurrent Operations
   - Problem: load() → modify → save() pattern not atomic
   - Fix: Added proper-lockfile for atomic writes
   - Result: No data loss under concurrent operations

2. Bug #2 (CRITICAL): ID Collision Risk
   - Problem: Date.now() + random could create duplicates
   - Fix: Replaced with crypto.randomUUID()
   - Result: Guaranteed unique IDs

3. Bug #3 (CRITICAL): No File Locking for Multi-Instance
   - Problem: Multiple bot instances could corrupt database
   - Fix: Implemented proper-lockfile with retry logic
   - Result: Multi-instance safe

4. Bug #4 (HIGH): Error Masking in load()
   - Problem: Silent failures hiding corruption
   - Fix: Added detailed error logging and recovery
   - Result: Better diagnostics and auto-recovery

5. Bug #5 (MEDIUM): Misleading Async Functions
   - Problem: Functions marked async but were synchronous
   - Fix: Made save() truly async with proper await
   - Result: Consistent async/await usage

FILES CHANGED:
- lib/memory.js (complete rewrite with all fixes)
- package.json (added proper-lockfile@4.1.2)
- tests/memory-simple.test.js (new comprehensive test suite)

Date: 2025-10-06
Session: GPT-4 Vision Integration for Super Snail

-------------------------------------------
1. NEW FEATURE: GPT-4 Vision Screenshot Analysis
-------------------------------------------

FEATURE:
- Added GPT-4 Vision API integration for analyzing Super Snail screenshots
- Extracts all 9 stats automatically: HP, ATK, DEF, RUSH, FAME, TECH, ART, CIV, FTH
- Provides confidence ratings (high/medium/low) for extraction accuracy
- Auto-detects and analyzes screenshots in super_snail mode channels
- 10-second per-user cooldown to prevent API spam

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Created lib/vision.js: Generic GPT-4 Vision wrapper with base64 conversion
- Created lib/snail-vision.js: Super Snail specific analyzer with JSON parsing
- Created handlers/snail-auto-detect.js: Auto-detection when images uploaded
- Updated commands/snail.js: Added /snail analyze subcommand
- Updated index.js: Attached snail-auto-detect handler at startup
- Added VISION_MODEL env var for model configuration

FILES CREATED:
- lib/vision.js (GPT-4 Vision API wrapper)
- lib/snail-vision.js (Super Snail stat extraction and formatting)
- handlers/snail-auto-detect.js (Auto-detect handler for super_snail mode)

FILES CHANGED:
- commands/snail.js (added 'analyze' subcommand)
- index.js (lines 206-218, attached snail-auto-detect handler)
- .env (added VISION_MODEL=gpt-4-vision-preview)
- package.json (added node-fetch@2.7.0 dependency)

USAGE:
1. Slash command: /snail analyze screenshot:[upload]
2. Auto-detect: Enable super_snail mode, then upload any screenshot
3. Bot extracts stats and displays formatted results

COST WARNING:
- GPT-4 Vision costs ~$0.01-0.02 per image analysis
- Cooldown prevents accidental spam
- Only active in channels with super_snail mode enabled

TESTING:
✅ lib/vision.js: Image URL to base64 conversion
✅ lib/snail-vision.js: JSON extraction and formatting
✅ handlers/snail-auto-detect.js: Auto-detection in super_snail channels
✅ commands/snail.js: /snail analyze subcommand
✅ Bot startup: All handlers attached successfully
✅ Existing /snail test and /snail calc still work

Date: 2025-10-05
Session: Bug fixes and feature improvements

-------------------------------------------
1. FIXED: Duplicate Command Loading
-------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
- Commands were loading twice (once during deploy-commands.js, once during bot startup)
- Memory module and other lib files printed initialization messages twice
- Caused by index.js accidentally being in /commands folder on Pterodactyl

SOLUTION:
- Added console output suppression in deploy-commands.js during command loading
- Prevents duplicate [memory] json-store ready and [dotenv] messages
- Removed index.js from commands directory (should only contain command files)

FILES CHANGED:
- deploy-commands.js (lines 11-29)

-------------------------------------------
2. FIXED: Image Generation in Mentions
-------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
- Bot would say "I can't display images directly" when mentioned with image requests
- Invalid model name 'gpt-image-1' causing API errors
- System prompt didn't tell the AI it could generate images
- Missing explicit response_format parameter

SOLUTION:
- Changed model from 'gpt-image-1' → 'dall-e-3'
- Added response_format: 'b64_json' to API calls
- Updated system prompt in persona.json to inform AI of image generation capability
- Added DALL-E 3 size support (1024x1024, 1024x1792, 1792x1024)
- Added logging to track image generation attempts

FILES CHANGED:
- lib/images.js (lines 5, 8)
- commands/image.js (lines 15-21, 48-51)
- config/slimy_ai.persona.json (added "prompt" field)
- lib/persona.js (getPersona now accepts mode parameter, lines 23-44)
- lib/auto-image.js (added logging lines 8-10, 30-34)

TESTING:
✅ Image intent detection works with API key
✅ Mention handler calls image generation
✅ DALL-E 3 size options validated

-------------------------------------------
3. FIXED: Memory.js listMemos Filter Bug
-------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
- /export in guilds was returning both guild notes AND DM notes
- Filter condition incorrectly used (!m.guildId || m.guildId === ...)
- DM notes (guildId: null) leaked into guild exports

SOLUTION:
- Changed filter from:
  m.userId === userId && (!m.guildId || m.guildId === (guildId || null))

  To strict equality:
  m.userId === userId && m.guildId === (guildId || null)

FILES CHANGED:
- lib/memory.js (line 257)

VALIDATION:
✅ Guild context: Returns only guild notes
✅ DM context: Returns only DM notes
✅ Delete operation: Works in correct scope
✅ Consent management: Unaffected
✅ All command flows tested end-to-end

-------------------------------------------
GIT COMMITS
-------------------------------------------

1. 8b04aa6 - Fix: duplicate command loading and enable image generation in mentions
2. 6c0601a - Fix: memory.js listMemos filter incorrectly including DM notes in guild queries

-------------------------------------------
DEPLOYMENT NOTES
-------------------------------------------

To deploy these fixes:

1. Pull latest changes on Pterodactyl server:
   cd /home/container
   git pull

2. Verify index.js is NOT in commands directory:
   ls -la commands/
   # Should only show: chat.js, consent.js, diag.js, export.js, forget.js,
   #                   image.js, mode.js, remember.js, snail.js

3. Restart the bot:
   pm2 restart slimy-bot
   # OR on Pterodactyl: use the restart button in panel

4. Test image generation:
   @slimy.ai draw me a cat riding a skateboard

5. Test memory commands:
   /consent allow:true
   /remember note:"Test guild note"
   /export
   # Should only show guild notes, not DM notes

-------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------

None currently identified.

-------------------------------------------
FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------------------------------

- Consider adding rate limiting for image generation
- Add cost tracking for OpenAI API usage
- Implement memory export as downloadable JSON file
- Add pagination for /export with >25 notes
