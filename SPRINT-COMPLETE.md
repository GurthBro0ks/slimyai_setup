## 🔧 Technical Details

### Rate Limiting Implementation
```javascript
const COOLDOWN_MS = 10000;
const cooldownMap = new Map();

// Per-user cooldown tracking
const userId = interaction.user.id;
const now = Date.now();
const lastUse = cooldownMap.get(userId) || 0;

if (now - lastUse < COOLDOWN_MS) {
  const waitTime = Math.ceil((COOLDOWN_MS - (now - lastUse)) / 1000);
  return interaction.reply({
    content: `⏳ Please wait ${waitTime}s`,
    flags: 64
  });
}
```

### Interactive Button Pattern
```javascript
const saveButton = new ButtonBuilder()
  .setCustomId(`save_snail_stats:${userId}:${Date.now()}`)
  .setLabel('💾 Save to Google Sheets')
  .setStyle(ButtonStyle.Success);

const collector = reply.createMessageComponentCollector({
  filter: i => i.customId.startsWith('save_snail_stats'),
  time: 60000
});

collector.on('collect', async i => {
  await i.deferUpdate();
  // Save to sheets
  await sheets.saveSnailStats({...});
  // Update message
});
```

### Google Sheets Authentication
```javascript
const auth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
  credentials: serviceAccountJSON,
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets']
});

const sheets = google.sheets({ version: 'v4', auth });
```
