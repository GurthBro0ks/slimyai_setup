Session Summary (auto-generated)
===============================

1. Consent Command Improvements
   - Deferred interactions and standardized crash handling to avoid ephemeral-only failures.

2. Mode System Overhaul
   - Replaced legacy per-user mode helpers with robust channel/category/thread storage (JSON-backed).
   - Rebuilt `/mode` with subcommands (set/view/list), admin gating, inheritance awareness, and cleaner summaries.
   - Added typed helper (`lib/modes.ts` + `lib/modes.js`) for future TS integration and wired the command to it.
   - Introduced content rating modes (`rating_unrated`, `rating_pg13`) with automatic validation and summaries.

3. Persona & Mentions
   - Moved persona spec to `config/` and generated runtime loader.
   - Unified `/chat` and mention replies around persona-aware prompts, shared history, and consistent formatting.
   - Mentions now mirror `/chat`, obeying cooldowns and suppressing slash-command hints.

4. Auto Image Generation
   - Added intent detection and OpenAI image helper; `/chat` and mentions auto-reply with images when prompted.
   - Image prompts respect content ratings (default, PG-13, Unrated) alongside text tone adjustments.

5. Additional Enhancements
   - Slash commands redeployed after key changes to keep Discord schema up to date.
   - Configured rating logic to auto-enable Chat + Personality and enforce mutual exclusivity.
   - Adjusted chat responses to remove redundant “Where we left off” tag line and tailor tone to modes.
