Session Worklog Summary
=======================

Consent & Chat Foundations
- Hardened `/consent` reply flow (defers, unified error handling) so consent toggles no longer crash or stay ephemeral-only.
- Unified `/chat` and mention handling around a shared conversation engine, persona-aware prompts, trimmed formatting, and public replies instead of ephemeral responses.
- Added content-aware tone controls: persona modes (personality / no_personality) and new rating flags (default, PG-13, Unrated) influence language guidance.

Mode System Overhaul
- Introduced JSON-backed channel/category/thread mode storage helpers (`lib/modes.ts` + generated `lib/modes.js`) with strong typing, inheritance resolution, sanitisation, and summaries.
- Replaced `/mode` with helper-driven logic (set/view/list/clear), admin gating, and direct/inherited/effective reporting.
- Simplified `/mode set` to curated profiles:
  • Chat × (Personality | No Personality) × (Rated | Unrated)
  • Super Snail × (Personality | No Personality) × (Rated | Unrated)
  • Plus "Clear" to remove all modes.
- Added `/mode list` filters and ensured ratings only stick when the matching persona/primary modes are active.

Persona & Rating Integration
- Relocated persona JSON to `config/`, built runtime loader, and injected persona/rating details into chat system prompts.
- Mentions mirror `/chat` exactly (cooldowns, no slash hints, same persona/rating/rules).

Auto Image Generation
- Added intent detection (`lib/image-intent.js`) and automatic OpenAI image replies for `/chat` and mentions.
- Auto images honour rating flags (PG-13 restrictions vs. Unrated creative freedom) and fall back to suggested compliant prompts when the safety filter rejects a request.

Quality & Housekeeping
- Broadened image prompt detection phrases and trimmed redundant catchphrases.
- Added `session-summary.txt` (this file) capturing the full session scope.
- Redeployed slash commands after each structural change and pushed commits to `main` throughout.
