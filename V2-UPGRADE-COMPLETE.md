## 🚀 Next Steps (Manual Setup Required)

### 1. Database Setup (REQUIRED)

The bot **requires** a MySQL/MariaDB database to function.

#### Option A: Cybrancee Panel
1. Create database: `slimy_ai_bot`
2. Create user: `slimy_bot_user`
3. Grant ALL PRIVILEGES
4. Update `.env` with credentials

#### Option B: Terminal/SSH
```bash
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE slimy_ai_bot CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'slimy_bot_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON slimy_ai_bot.* TO 'slimy_bot_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

📖 **See DATABASE-SETUP.md for detailed instructions**

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file:

```bash
# Database (REQUIRED)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=slimy_bot_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DB_NAME=slimy_ai_bot

# OpenAI (already configured)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
VISION_MODEL=gpt-4o
IMAGE_MODEL=dall-e-3

# Google Sheets (Optional)
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./google-service-account.json
# OR
# GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account",...}
```

### 3. Migrate Data (If Upgrading from v1.x)

```bash
# Backup current data
cp data_store.json data_store.json.backup

# Run migration
node scripts/migrate-to-database.js

# Verify migration
# The script will show detailed migration statistics
```

### 4. Deploy Commands

```bash
# Deploy new commands to Discord
npm run deploy

# For testing (instant updates to one server):
# Set DISCORD_GUILD_ID in .env first
npm run deploy
```

### 5. Restart Bot

```bash
# If using PM2
pm2 restart slimy-bot

# Or start normally
npm start
```

### 6. Test New Features

Test each new feature:

```bash
# Test database connection
/consent status

# Test memory system
/consent memory enable:true
/remember note:"Test note" tags:"testing,v2"
/export

# Test new image generation
/dream styles
/dream create prompt:"A cute robot" style:anime

# Test Google Sheets (if configured)
/consent sheets enable:true
/snail analyze (upload screenshot)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Breaking Changes

- **Consent is server-wide** - Not per-channel anymore
- **Note:** The former "imagine" and `/image` slash commands are fully retired — use `/dream` moving forward
- **File storage deprecated** - Must migrate to database

### Data Migration
- Run migration script **before** deleting data_store.json
- Migration creates backup automatically
- Old channel modes are NOT migrated (new system in v2.0)

### Google Sheets (Optional)
- Requires Google Cloud service account
- Spreadsheets are created on-demand per user/server
- Stats are automatically saved from `/snail analyze`

---

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total files changed:** 16
- **Lines of code added:** ~2,500+
- **New commands:** 1 (/dream with subcommands)
- **Updated commands:** 4 (/consent, /remember, /export, /forget)
- **New libraries:** 3 (database, personality-engine, sheets-creator)
- **Dependencies added:** 1 (mysql2)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Errors
- Verify credentials in `.env`
- Check MySQL is running: `systemctl status mysql`
- Test connection: `node -e "require('./lib/database').testConnection()"`
- See DATABASE-SETUP.md for detailed troubleshooting

### Migration Issues
- Ensure database is created first
- Check file permissions on data_store.json
- Backup is created automatically in backups/
- Check migration logs for specific errors

### Command Deployment Issues
- Verify DISCORD_CLIENT_ID in .env
- Check bot has applications.commands scope
- Global commands take ~1 hour to propagate
- Use DISCORD_GUILD_ID for instant testing
